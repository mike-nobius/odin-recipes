    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 approximately 13oz bottle Seasoned Rice Wine Vinegar</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, julienned</li>
        <li>1 Tbs salt</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <div id="method">
        <p>In a non reactive bowl or jar, combine all ingredients. Don't worry about dissolving the salt as it will happen as the onions leech out their water. Let sit in the fridge at least 24 hours. Keeps for a month in the fridge.</p>
