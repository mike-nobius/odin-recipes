    <h1>Falafel</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>1 lbs hulled & split fava beans. Alternative: small lima beans</li>
        <li>1 lbs garbonzo beans</li>
        <li>1 small red onion</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions</li>
        <li>1 bunch parsley</li>
        <li>2 large jalapeno peppers, or 3 serano, or a poblano, substitute a green bell pepper if you don't like heat. Any green chile will do</li>
        <li>1 bunch cilantro</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbs ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 Tbs ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 Tbs ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbs coarse kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Oil, for frying. I prefer to use light, refined, or a lighter flavored extra virgin olive oil. Ghee or peanut oil are also great choices. Any frying oil is fine.</li>
        <li><em>Optional: one small waxy potato, like red or yellow</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
        <div id="instructions">
            <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Begin by soaking your beans overnight. Note that this can only be accomlished with dried beans. Canned will absolutely not work in this recipe.</li>
                <li>Once your beans are soaked, drain thoroughly and set in a strainer to drain further while you prepare other ingredients</li>
                <li>Using a food processor, pulse together all of the onions, garlic and herbs into a fine paste. Do so in batches if it all cannot fit. Add your salt and herbs to this mixture to help distribute evenly</li>
                <li>Place your herb & onion paste into a separate large bowl and replace your food processor's pitcher. No need to clean it thoroughly. In batches, begin blitzing your beans into a relatively fine paste. Use this to form a batter. This consistency will get you a lighter, crispier and fluffier falafel. If you prefer a crunchier falafel, blitz the beans until they take on the consistency of wet sand. If you're using a potato as extra binding, blitz it with the beans. Transfer to a bowl with your herb & seasoning mixture. Mix together until homogenous. Let sit for a minimum of 30 minutes to allow the starches from the beans to congeal.</li>
                <li>Pour a few inches of oil into a pan or pot for frying. If you don't have a fryer, a flat bottom wok is a great choice for this. Anything with high, straight sides. Remember that the oil will expand as it heats up</li>
                <li>While waiting for your oil to heat up, stir in your baking soda and powder into your batter.</li>
                <li>Heat your oil to 375F or 190C, with the end goal being a frying temperature of 350F. We're accounting for the drop in temperature caused by the addition of cold batter into the oil.</li>
                <li>Using a falafel scoop, a wet spoon, or even your wet hands, scoop out the batter and form little patties or balls, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter, and gently drop them into the hot oil. Be careful not to overcrowd your oil so the temperature doesn't drop too rapidly. Fry until golden brown, then pull from the oil and drain thoroughly on a tea towel or on a cooling rack. Salt immediately after pulling out of the oil</li>
                <li>Optional: if you're not consuming all of this falafel at once, you can freeze the remaining batter for later, OR fry the remaining falafel you won't eat a little lighter than you'd prefer. This way, you can reheat the falafel in your oven or air fryer and the residual oil in it will help cook it just as well as fresh out the fryer, and it will even be slightly healthier since some of the oil will drain out in the reheating process. Freeze these patties on a sheet pan until solid to prevent sticking, then place together in a bag for later.</li>
            </ol>
            Serve with any variety of Levantine sauces: <a href="./harissa.html">Harissa</a>, <a href="./toum.html">Toum</a>, <a href="./tahina.html"> Tahina</a> are great choices.
